#QRcraft

Plugin for PocketMine-MP for creating QR stuff


## Commands

ONLY OPs during gameplay (creative preferred)
* `/qr` - shows help page
* `/qrt <url>` - test QR code text/url to count number of needed blocks (NxN)
* `/qrc <url> [Auto|horizontal|vertical]` - create QR code panel
* `/qrl` - list QR code panels IDs
* `/qrd <ID>` - delete QR code panel by ID (fills panel space with air)
* `/qrp <ID>` - teleports the player nearby QR code panel with specified ID

Example:
* `/qrt http://google.com`
```
"QR panel for 'http://google.com' will need 27x27 blocks"
```
* `/qrc http://google.com` - begins the creation for specified url in auto mode
```
"QR panel defined a (27x27) for 'http://google.com'"
"Touch a block to create it!"
    - NOW the player has to touch another block to create the QR code panel.
    - the new panel will be created above touched block and to the player right side.
    - in auto mode, is player is inclined forward pointing downwards, 
        the QR code panel will be generated horizontally,
        otherwise it will be generated vertically.
"QR panel [1] created OK!"
```
* `/qrc http://google.com h` - begins the creation for specified url in horizontal mode
```
"QR panel defined h (27x27) for 'http://google.com'"
"Touch a block to create it!"
    - now the player touches the block to build above.
"QR panel [2] created OK!"
```
* `/qrl` - list current defined QR code panels
```
 "--------------"
 "QR LIST"
 "--------------"
 "[1] 'http://google.com' (27) x:10-y:20-z:30"
 "[2] 'http://google.com' (27) x:30-y:20-z:30"
 "--------------"
```
* `/qrd 2` - deletes the QR panel with ID 2
```
"QR panel [2] deleted."
```
* `/qrp 2` - teleports the player nearby QR panel with ID 2
